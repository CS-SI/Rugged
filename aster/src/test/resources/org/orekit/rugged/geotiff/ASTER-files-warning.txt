For test purposes, some ASTER files should be put in the same folder as this file.

ASTER stands for Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer
and is a joint effort of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of
Japan and the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
More information on how to get the files is available here:

  http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp

The Rugged library cannot distribute such test files, so the distributed folder
contains only this warning text file and no real ASTER files. If the folder still does
not contain any ASTER files at tests run time, the content of this file is displayed
as a warning but the tests won't fail.

If users want to really perform tests, they have to retrieve ASTER files by themselves
and copy them in the folder. Then the files will automatically been picked up and used
for the tests. The files must have a name of the form ASTGTM2_v##h###.zip, where v
stands for either N or S, h stands for either E or W and # stands for digits. The zip
files themselves are used for the tests, users should not extract the _dem.tif files.
