Rugged can be built from source either using maven 3 or eclipse.

Building with Maven 3:
 - Maven 3 can be downloaded here:
       http://maven.apache.org/download.html
 - If you are behind a proxy (which is a traditional
   setting in a corporate environment), then you need
   to configure maven to use it. This is explained
   in the maven documentation here:
   http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html
 - run "mvn package" to automatically download all
   the required dependencies listed in the pom.xml file
   and create a file named target/rugged-x.y.jar where
   x.y is the version number

Building with Eclipse:
 - Eclipse can be downloaded here:
       http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
 - extract the rugged source jar in your eclipse workspace
 - create a new java project from existing sources and direct
   Eclipse to the directory where you unpacked Rugged
 - set the source folders to rugged/src/main/java,
   rugged/src/main/resources, rugged/src/test/java,
   rugged/src/test/resources in
   the source tab of the Configure Build Path dialog
 - set the external libraries to JRE system library (provided by Eclipse),
   Junit 4.x (provided by Eclipse) orekit (available at Orekit website
   https://www.orekit.org/) and Hipparchus (available at
    Hipparchus project downloads page https://www.hipparchus.org/downloads.html)
   in the libraries tab of the Configure Build Path dialog
