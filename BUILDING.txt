Rugged can be built from source either using maven 3 or eclipse.

Building with Maven 3:
 - Maven 3 can be downloaded here:
       http://maven.apache.org/download.html
 - If you are behind a proxy (which is a traditional
   setting in a corporate environment), then you need
   to configure maven to use it. This is explained
   in the maven documentation here:
   http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html
 - run "mvn package" to automatically download all
   the required dependencies listed in the pom.xml file
   and create a file named target/rugged-x.y.jar where
   x.y is the version number

Building with Eclipse:
 - Eclipse can be downloaded here:
       http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
 - using your operating system tools, unpack the source distribution directly
   inside your Eclipse workspace
 - using Eclipse, import the project by selecting in the top level "File" menu
   the entry "Import..."
 - in the wizard that should appear, select "Maven -> Existing Maven Projects"
 - select the folder you just created in your workspace by unpacking the
   source distribution. The "pom.xml" file describing the project will be
   automatically selected. Click finish
