# Building Rugged

Rugged can be built from source using several different tools.
  
All these tools are Java based and can run on many different operating
systems, including Unix, GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Some GNU/Linux
distributions provide these tools in their packages repositories.

## Building with Maven 3

[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/ "Maven homepage") is a build tool that goes far beyond
simply compiling and packaging a product. It is also able to resolve
dependencies (including downloading the appropriate versions from the public
repositories), to run automated tests, to launch various checking tools and
to create a web site for a project. It runs on any platform supporting Java.
  
For systems not providing maven as a package, maven can be
[downloaded](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) from its site at the
Apache Software Foundation. This site also explains the
installation procedure.

As with all maven enabled projects, building official released versions of
Rugged is straightforward (see below for the special case of development versions),
simply run:

    mvn package

The preceding command will perform all dependencies retrieval, compilation,
tests and packaging for you. At the end, it will create several files in
the target directory, including one file named rugged-x.y.jar where x.y is
the version number. This is the jar file you can use in your project using
Rugged.

This command should always work for released Rugged versions as they
always depend only on released Orekit versions. Maven knows how
to download the pre-built binary for released Orekit versions.
The previous command may not work for development Rugged versions as they
may depend on unreleased Orekit versions. Maven cannot download
pre-built binaries for unreleased Orekit versions as none are
publicly available. In this case the command above will end with an error message
like:

    [ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project rugged: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.orekit:rugged:jar:X.x-SNAPSHOT: Could not find artifact org.orekit:orekit:jar:Y.y-SNAPSHOT

In this case, you should build the missing Orekit artifact and
install it in your local maven repository beforehand. This is done by cloning
the Orekit source from Orekit git repository at Gitlab in some
temporary folder and install it with maven. This is done by
running the commands below (using Linux command syntax):

    git clone -b develop https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit/orekit.git
    cd orekit
    mvn install
    
If, in a similar way, the command above ends with an error message like:
 
    [ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project orekit: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.orekit:orekit:jar:Y.y-SNAPSHOT: 
            The following artifacts could not be resolved: org.hipparchus:hipparchus-core:jar:Z.z-SNAPSHOT, org.hipparchus:hipparchus-geometry:jar:Z.z-SNAPSHOT,   
            ... 
            Could not find artifact org.hipparchus:hipparchus-core:jar:Z.Z-SNAPSHOT

Before building the Orekit artefact, you should start by building the missing Hipparchus artifact 
and install it in your local maven repository 
beforehand, in the same way as Orekit, by cloning
the Hipparchus source from Hipparchus git repository at GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/Hipparchus-Math/hipparchus.git
    cd hipparchus
    mvn install

Once the Orekit (and possibly Hipparchus) development version has been installed locally using
the previous commands, you can delete the cloned folder if you want. You can then
attempt again the mvn command at Rugged level, this time it should succeed as the
necessary artifact is now locally available.

If you need to configure a proxy server for dependencies retrieval, see
the [Guide to using proxies](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html)
page at the maven site.

If you already use maven for your own projects (or simply eclipse, see
below), you may want to install rugged in your local maven repository. This is done
with the following command:

    mvn install

For other commands like generating the site, or generating the
[checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/ "Checkstyle homepage"),
[spotbugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/ "Spotbugs homepage") or
[jacoco](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/ "Jacoco homepage") reports, see the maven
plugins documentation at [maven site](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/index.html "Maven plugins homepage").

## Building with Eclipse

[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/  "Eclipse homepage") is a very rich Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). It is a huge product and not a simple build tool.

For systems not providing eclipse as a package, it can be downloaded from its
site at the [Eclipse Foundation](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

The simplest way to use Rugged with Eclipse is to follow these steps:

  * using your operating system tools, unpack the source distribution directly
  inside your Eclipse workspace. The source distribution file name has a name
  of the form rugged-x.y-sources.zip where x.y is the version number. Unpacking
  this zip file should create a folder of the form rugged-x.y in your workspace.
  

  * using Eclipse, import the project by selecting in the top level "File" menu
    the entry "Import..."

  * in the wizard that should appear, select "Maven -> Existing Maven Projects"

  * select the folder you just created in your workspace by unpacking the
    source distribution. The "pom.xml" file describing the project will be
    automatically selected. Click finish

The Rugged library should be configured automatically, including the dependency
to the underlying Orekit library.

Now you have an rugged-x.y project in you workspace, and you can create your
own application projects that will depend on the Rugged project.

You can also check everything works correctly by running the junit tests.
