# Building Rugged

Rugged can be built from source using several different tools.
  
All these tools are Java based and can run on many different operating
systems, including Unix, GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Some GNU/Linux
distributions provide these tools in their packages repositories.

## Building with Maven 3

[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) is a build tool that goes far beyond
simply compiling and packaging a product. It is also able to resolve
dependencies (including downloading the appropriate versions from the public
repositories), to run automated tests, to launch various checking tools and
to create a web site for a project. It runs on any platform supporting Java.
  
For systems not providing maven as a package, maven can be
[downloaded](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) from its site at the
Apache Software Foundation. This site also explains the
installation procedure.

As with all maven enabled projects, building Rugged is straightforward, simply
run:

    mvn package

The preceding command will perform all dependencies retrieval, compilation,
tests and packaging for you. At the end, it will create several files in
the target directory, including one file named rugged-x.y.jar where x.y is
the version number. This is the jar file you can use in your project using
Rugged.

If you need to configure a proxy server for dependencies retrieval, see
the [Guide to using proxies](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html)
page at the maven site.

If you already use maven for your own projects (or simply eclipse, see
below), you may want to install rugged in your local repository. This is done
with the following command:

    mvn install

For other commands like generating the site, or generating the
[checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/),
[findbugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) or
[jacoco](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) reports, see the maven
plugins documentation at [maven site](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/index.html).

## Building with Eclipse

[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) is a very rich Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). It is a huge product and not a simple build tool.

For systems not providing eclipse as a package, it can be downloaded from its
site at the [Eclipse Foundation](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

The simplest way to use Rugged with Eclipse is to follow these steps:

  * unpack the distribution inside your Eclipse workspace

  * create a new java project from existing sources and direct Eclipse to the
     directory where you unpacked Rugged

  * set the source folders to
    * src/main/java
    * src/test/java
    * src/main/resources
    * src/test/resources

    in the source tab of the Configure Build Path dialog

  * set the external libraries to JRE system library (provided by Eclipse),
    Junit 4.x (provided by Eclipse), Hipparchus (available at
    Hipparchus project
    [downloads page](https://www.hipparchus.org/downloads.html)),
    and Orekit (available at Orekit
    [download page](https://www.orekit.org/download.html))
    in the libraries tab of the Configure Build Path dialog
