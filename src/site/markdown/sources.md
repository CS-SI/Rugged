Getting the sources
===================

Released versions
-----------------

`In order to get the source for officially released versions, go to the
[Files](https://www.orekit.org/forge/projects/rugged/files) tab in Rugged
forge` and select one of the rugged-{module}-x.y-src.zip files. The module
part is the module (you need at least the core module, but other modules
may be interesting for you too). The x.y part in the name specifies the version.

Development version
-------------------

The development of the Rugged project is done using the [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
source code control system. Rugged Git master repository is available online.

You can browse it using `the [Repository](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit/rugged)
tab in Rugged forge`.

`You can clone it anonymously with the command:`

     git clone https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit/rugged.git

`If you are a committer, you can clone it using your ssh credentials with the command:`

     git clone git@gitlab.orekit.org:orekit/rugged.git
  
`In both cases, the development version is under the branch develop TO BE COMPLETED`.
