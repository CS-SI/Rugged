Overview
========

  Rugged is an add-on for Orekit handling Digital Elevation Models
  contribution to line of sight computation. It is a free software
  low-level library written in Java.

  It mainly provides direct and inverse localization, i.e. it allows
  to compute accurately which ground point is looked at from a specific
  pixel in a spacecraft instrument, and conversely which pixel will
  see a specified ground point.

Features
--------

  * Direct localization

  * Inverse localization

  * Localized in several languages

    * English

    * French

    * Galician

Free software
-------------

Rugged is freely available both in source and binary formats, with all related
documentation and tests.

It is distributed under the [Apache License Version 2.0](./license.html). This
is a well known business-friendly license. This means anybody can use it to build
any application, free or not. There are no strings attached to your own code.

Everybody is encouraged to use Orekit as a common low level layer to improve
interoperability in space systems.

Maintained library
------------------

Rugged has been in development since 2013 inside [CS Systèmes
d'Information](http://www.c-s.fr/) and is still used and maintained by its dual teams
of space dynamics and image processing experts.

Rugged is used for image processing of the Sentinel 2 missiong at European Space
Agency (ESA).
