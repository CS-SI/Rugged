# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## References

### Has Rugged already been used?

Yes, it has been used in successful operational missions. 

Rugged is used operationally in the Image Processing Facility
of the Sentinel 2 European Space Agency (ESA) mission, which was launched in June 2015.

Rugged is used in the frame of ESA Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions (SEOM), 
to calculate topographic shadow masks for Sentinel 2 products.

Rugged has been used to validate Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) geolocation library.

Rugged has been used as a Research Library by the French Space Agency (CNES) for
refinement studies for VHR push broom sensors (Pleiades).

### Is Rugged validated?

Yes, Rugged has been validated, by comparison with other image
processing systems.

Note that as Rugged takes into account some effects that may not be considered
by other systems, validation implies careful configuration and analysis of
discrepancies. Some differences come from missing correction in other systems,
like the Δδψ and Δδε precession/nutation correction parameters, or the light time
correction, or the aberration of light correction, or the non-straight line nature
of line-of-sight in geodetic space ... These differences are mostly dealt with
by disabling Rugged correction to match the other systems (only for test purposes,
of course, the corrections should be enabled for operational use!). Some differences
come from different models like precession and nutation compliant to latest IERS
conventions, or different Earth frames. These differences are mostly dealt with by
configuring Rugged to use the same legacy models (these legacy models like for example
TOD and MOD frames are available for consistency with existing systems).


## Installation

### What are the dependencies for Rugged?

Rugged relies on the [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/ "Orekit homepage") space flight dynamics library and on
[Hipparchus](https://hipparchus.org/ "Hipparchus homepage") mathematical libraries. Both libraries are free
software libraries distributed under the terms of the Apache Software
License version 2.0.

## Runtime errors

### I get an error "no IERS UTC-TAI history data loaded" (or something similar in another language). What does it mean?

This error is probably *the* most frequent one, or at least it's the first one new users encounter.

Rugged relies on the Orekit library to perform all space flight related computation (typically
frames transforms). This library in turn needs some external data to be loaded in order to run.
This includes UTC-TAI history for leap seconds handling, Earth Orientation Parameters for
transforms to and from Earth fixed frames, or planetary ephemerides for Sun direction, for example.

The error message "no IERS UTC-TAI history data loaded" means the UTC-TAI history file which is used for leap
seconds management was not found. As leap seconds are used each time a UTC date is used, this message is
often seen very early and is the first one unsuspecting users experience. It often means the user forgot
to configure Orekit to load data. Orekit supports by default either the IERS UTC-TAI.history file or the
USNO tai-utc.dat file. If either file is found in the Orekit configuration, it will be automatically loaded
and the message should not appear.

Configuring data loading is explained in the configuration page. For a start, the simplest configuration
 is to download the [orekit-data-master.zip](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit/orekit-data/-/archive/master/orekit-data-master.zip)
file from the forge, to unzip it anywhere you want, rename the `orekit-data-master` folder that will be created
into `orekit-data` and add the following lines at the start of your program:

    File orekitData = new File("/path/to/the/folder/orekit-data");
    DataProvidersManager manager = DataContext.getDefault().getDataProvidersManager();
    manager.addProvider(new DirectoryCrawler(orekitData));

Using a folder allows one to change the data in it after the initial download, e.g., adding new EOP files as they
are published by IERS. Updating the content of the orekit-data remains the responsibility of the user.
