     It adds refraction in inverse location and fixes a few bugs. This version depends
     on Orekit 9.3.1 and Hipparchus 1.4.">
      <action dev="guylaine" type="update">
        Updated dependencies to Orekit 9.3.1 and Hipparchus 1.4.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="376">
        Direct location may result to a null result in some very rugged region.
        In Duvenhage algorithm, in the refineIntersection method for the DEM, 
        some rare cases led to no intersection (as a result from SimpleTile.cellIntersection) 
        with the closeGuess given as input of refineIntersection.By shifting the solution 
        along the LOS direction, with an iterative process, we are able to find the intersection.
      </action>
      <action dev="guylaine" type="fix" issue="377">
        Add the possibility to suspend and resume the dump.
        When performing a dump, in some cases, some extra informations are dumped 
        but are not relevant. 
        For instance when updating a tile for a SRTM tile, we need to add the geoid
        value of the current point. In the dump file, the geoid tile is also dumped
        and it leads to bad results when performing the DumpReplayer, as the geoid 
        elevations are read instead of the real elevations.
      </action>
      <action dev="guylaine" type="update">
        Enable null in dump of direct or inverse location results.
        If direct or inverse location gave "null" as a result, it was not dumped.
      </action>
      <action dev="guylaine" type="update">
        Improve test coverage of classes related to dump (org.orekit.rugged.errors).
      </action>
      <action dev="guylaine" type="fix" issue="373">
        Changed RuggedException from checked to unchecked exception.
        Most functions do throw such exceptions. As they are unchecked, they are
        not advertised in either `throws` statements in the function signature or
        in the javadoc. So users must consider that as soon as they use any Rugged
        feature, an unchecked `RuggedException` may be thrown. In most cases, users
        will not attempt to recover for this but will only use them to display or
        log a meaningful error message.
      </action>
      <action dev="guylaine" type="fix" issue="372">
        Add (optional) atmospheric refraction for inverse location. 
        In Rugged 2.0, only the direct location can take into account the atmospheric refraction.
      </action>
      <action dev="guylaine" type="add" due-to="Issam Boukerch">

      <action dev="luc" type="add" >

        First working version of inverse location.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Streamlined line sensor model.
        We now use a single position for all pixels (but of course still
        different line-of-sight vectors), as it doesn't really make sense to
        consider different positions as pixels are only a few microns away from
        each other.

        Ensure sensor mean plane normal has a deterministic orientation.

        Slightly changed the intersection refinement in flat-body.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Added a flat-body implementation of refineIntersection.
        The former implementation ignored the flat-body flag and in fact

        Fixed mean reference point position.

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Improved light time correction.
        The current altitude must be considered when computing light time
        correction. Previous computation was slightly wrong as it only computed
        light time from the ellipsoid. This induced problems when computing
        inverse correction.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        Fixed computation of latitude crossings for line of sight.
        In some cases, the line of sight has two intersections with a given
        iso-latitude cone, and the selecting the closes one to spacecraft was
        not always the appropriate choice. An hint from the caller was needed,
        as a point close to the desired intersection.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        Fixed non-bracketing error near start of sensor line.

        Improved speed of inverse location test.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        First working version of inverse location.
        It works in simple cases (no light time correction and no aberration of
        light correction), and is still really slow.

        Started implementation of inverse location (not working yet).

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Removed a check that is not needed anymore.
        The indices are now checked at caller level.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Added an option to use Duvenhage algorithm with flat-Earth hypothesis.
        This option is mainly intended for comparison with existing systems. It
        should not be used for operational systems and the full Duvenhage
        algorithm with line-of-sight bending in geodetic coordinates should be
        used instead.

        Allow direct use of Orekit inertial frames and ellipsoids.

        Added optional aberration of light correction.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Renamed ligth travel time compensation into light time correction.
        This better matches physics naming conventions.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Moved light travel compensation setting out of construction.
        This setting is not intended to be used often (in fact it should be used
        only for validation against other systems), so forcing user to set it in
        all cases was a bad idea. Now the default configuration is to compensate
        and if user does not want to compensate, he can inhibate it by calling a
        separate method after construction.

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Removed SatellitePV and SatelliteQ classes.
        We now use directly Orekit PVCoordinates and Apache Commons Math
        Rotation classes.

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Don't use a numerical propagator within direct location.

        New global test (temporary, much too computing intensive).

        Avoid line-of-sight splitting before its start.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        Fixed a numerical issue at tile exit.
        The low point at tile minimum elevation was computed with a tiny
        positive error, meaning the point really was above min elevation (at
        micrometer level). The line segment between entry and exit stopped just
        before traversing the Digital Elevation Model, and an error was
        triggered.
        The solution was to take some margin when computing the segment
        endpoints at entry and exit: we now start above max elevation and end
        below min elevation so the intersection should be really on the line.

        Greatly improved accuracy of direct location.
        There were some small errors (at centimeter level) as result points may
        be slightly out of line of sight. These errors seemed to be due to the
        final linear line-of-sight model that is used at pixel level.
        An iterative correction step is performed to ensure the point is really
        on the line-of-sight.
        The residual error is now at nanometer level.

        Added a los conversion between Cartesian and geodetic coordinates.
        The conversion is of course accurate only in the neighborhood of the
        reference point, as a straight line in Cartesian is not a straight line
        in geodetic coordinates. What is converted is the initial direction so
        the two curves are tangent at the reference point.
        Near Earth surface, the two curves remain within one millimeter of each
        other after about 100 m travel.
